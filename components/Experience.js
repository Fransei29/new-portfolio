        I have worked on numerous projects as a 
        <strong> Freelancer Developer</strong>, delivering tailored solutions that meet diverse client needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> at <strong>Digital Innovators</strong>, I significantly enhanced user engagement by building and 
        maintaining <u>SPAs</u> with <strong>React</strong> and 
        <strong> Redux</strong>, resulting in a <strong>15%</strong> increase in user retention.
      </p>
      <p>
        My optimizations led to a <strong>20% improvement in conversion rates</strong>, 
        and my contributions to an internal component library reduced future development 
        time by <strong>30%</strong>.
